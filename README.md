A **Machine Learning–based soil analysis project** designed to predict soil fertility levels using key soil parameters. This project demonstrates a complete ML workflow implemented in a **Jupyter Notebook**, focusing on accuracy, interpretability, and real-world agricultural relevance.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Soil fertility is a critical factor in agricultural productivity and sustainable farming. Traditional soil testing methods involve laboratory analysis, which can be costly and time-consuming.
This project applies **machine learning techniques** to analyze soil nutrient data and predict fertility levels efficiently and accurately.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform exploratory data analysis on soil attributes
* Preprocess and clean soil data for modeling
* Train multiple supervised machine learning models
* Evaluate models using standard performance metrics
* Demonstrate an end-to-end ML pipeline in a single notebook

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Loading & Understanding**
   Soil data is imported and inspected for structure and completeness.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Visualizations are used to identify trends, correlations, and anomalies.

3. **Data Preprocessing**
   Feature scaling, handling missing values, and preparing data for training.

4. **Model Training**
   Multiple machine learning classifiers are trained on the processed dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   Performance is measured using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.
